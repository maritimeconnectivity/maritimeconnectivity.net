* `PortCDM <http://stmvalidation.eu/news/portcdm-information-sharing-in-real-time/>`__ : Port Collaborative Decision Making (Port CDM) services will make port calls more efficient for all stakeholders through improved information sharing, situational awareness, optimised processes, and collaborative decision making during port calls. Port CDM will be validated by expanding the network the Nordic and Mediterranean regions. The contextual differences between port approaches will be analysed, and will serve as a basis for refining the concept. The test beds will also be the first step towards involving commercial and public service developers/distributors in building Port CDM Services. PortCDM has investigated on how to utilize the MCP as a login mechanism based on Keycloak; refer `this Microsoft Word file <https://github.com/MaritimeConnectivityPlatform/developers.maritimeconnectivity.net/raw/gh-pages/identity/docx/The%20use%20of%20MCP%20as%20login-mechanism.docx>`__.
